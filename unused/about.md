## About

School for poetic computation was founded by Amit, Jen, Taeyoon and Zach in 2013. We are a group of artists, hackers and educators who are super committed to open source and open hardware, to radical openness and generosity. Each semester, we work with new teachers and visiting artists to make an ideal school. In spring 2014, Zach, Taeyoon and Casey are leading administration of the school.

## Who We Are

![](/img/people.jpg)

### Zach Lieberman

[Zach](http://thesystemis.com/) is an artist with a simple goal: he wants you surprised. His work uses technology in a playful way to break down the fragile boundary between the visible and the invisible. He has held residencies at Ars Electronica Futurelab, Eyebeam, Dance Theater Workshop, and the Hangar Center for the Arts in Barcelona, and his work has been exhibited around the world.

Zach is one of the co-founders of openFrameworks, a C++ library for creative coding. He's currently working on the EyeWriter project, a low-cost, open source hardware and software toolkit that helps people draw with their eyes. The project has won the Design of the Year from the London Design Museum, FutureEverything prize and the Golden Nica in Interactive Art at Ars Electronica. It was also listed by Time Magazine as one the 50 best inventions in 2010. Zach is one of the recipients of the AOL 25 for 25 grant, and was listed in Fast Company Magazine’s 100 Creative people in business. He teaches at Parsons School of Design.

### Amit Pitaru

[Amit](http://pitaru.com/) is a coder and designer. Formerly a professional musician, his work to date spans across experimental art, research, education, and entrepreneurial projects. A recurring theme in Amit’s work is the extreme attention to user-experience, specifically how technology can promote (or destroy) curiosity, literacy, and creativity.

As an artist, Amit develops novel instruments and methods for making music, animation, and dance. His work has been exhibited at the London Design Museum, Paris Pompidou Center, Lincoln Center, Israel National Museum, Sundance Film festival, Seoul Metropolitan Museum of Art, and ICC Museum in Tokyo.

As an educator, Amit develops curricula that focus on the coupling of technology and the creative thought process. He taught at New York University’s ITP and Cooper Union’s Arts department. Interested in alternative education environments, Amit is also the co founder of Kitchen Table Coders, hosting intimate workshops/salons for people who are eager to expand their love for coding.

### Jen Lowe

[Jen](http://www.datatelling.com/) is a researcher working on data visualization and communication and talking about the implications of data in society. She collaborates with scientists and designers to make new things, from visualizations of wind in clear air to novel statistical tools for font generation. Her education is in applied math and information science. Long, long ago she was a high school and college math and science teacher. Her approach to education is: everyone's invited.

Jen was an Associate Research Scholar in the [Spatial Information Design Lab](http://www.spatialinformationdesignlab.org/) at Columbia University. A sucker for a good argument, she'll nearly always side with complexity. These are her [favorite](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/171140) [poems](http://www.theparisreview.org/poetry/6090/two-poems-kevin-prufer) today.

### Casey Gollan

[Casey](http://caseyagollan.com) studied art and design at Cooper Union. He works with <a href="http://facebook.com/freecooperunion"><em>Free</em> Cooper Union</a> to uphold the school's mission of "Free Education to All," and come up with ways to help people let go of broken/doomed paradigms. He is a Fall 2013 fellow at BHQFU where he is organizing [conversations](http://bhqfu.org/they-cant-kill-us-all), [lectures](http://bhqfu.org/lecture-series), [group research](http://education.hackpad.com), and action on issues of education and student power.
