## Call for Students: Code Societies
- Three-Week Session, Monday July 2nd – Saturday July 21st
- @ SFPC, 155 Bank Street, West Village, NYC
- 6:30pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes
- Applications have closed


SFPC's Summer Intensive, Code Societies will examine the ideological and mythological attributes of computation, concentrating on the poetics and politics of culturally embedded software.
How do different platforms and processes — including algorithms, data collection, social media, networks, simulation, and ritual — yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, and feeling, structure social organization, and reinforce existing systems of power? Through a balanced study of critical theory and hands-on making workshops, students will create several small projects that explore and question these ideas. Students will be introduced to Python and discover poetic, playful, and powerful ways to use computation. All levels of programming ability welcome and an enthusiastic willingness to reconsider how code shapes and is shaped by society required!

*“Technology is not neutral. We're inside of what we make, and it's inside of us. We're living in a world of connections — and it matters which ones get made and unmade.”* - Donna Haraway

### What will happen in these three weeks?
Classes are held in the evenings Monday-Friday from 6:30-9:30pm with a day off on July 4th. SFPC space will be open for students on weekdays between 1pm-6pm. The session will culminate in a party on the afternoon of Saturday July 21st, where students can invite their friends and present their favorite projects.

Students will have full access to the space for the two weeks of the session to work on projects between classes and mentors will be readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance.

### How do I apply?
Applications have closed.

We accept up to 18 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within 2 weeks of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!

### How competitive is the admissions?

SFPC admissions is highly competitive. Every session, we receive up to 80 applicants and select 18. We focus on creating diversity among our student body. We work with a group of alumni and teachers to review and select students based on their work samples and essays.

### How much is tuition?
$2,500 USD for the 3-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $800 - $1400). Upon acceptance, payment of full tuition, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible.

### Do you offer scholarships?

We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. In Code Societies, we are offering two work-study opportunity to a qualified applicant who would be expected to work 5 hrs/week in exchange for a 50% reduction of tuition.  We’re particularly looking out for women, people of color, disabled person, people under-represented in the field of art + technology, and those with financial need.

Please note that if you apply for work study, we will consider your application separately from the general admissions applications, since we have little flexibility regarding scholarships. This is for people who absolutely need assistance to participate in SFPC. Occasionally, students have received support from cultural foundations, schools or current employers and we are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance.

### Cancellation and refund policy

- If you are accepted between April and May, but if you need to cancel, we can give you 100% refund up to June 15th, 2018.
- 50% refund between June 15th – July 27th, 2018.
- 25% refund between June 28th – July 1st, 2018.
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class.

### What is expected of me?

- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
