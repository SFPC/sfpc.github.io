# Artist Statement Workshop: A User Guide

Date: Starting in June 1st, 2020 on Mondays. 5 sessions of weekly 3 hours classes 

Teacher: Celine Wong Katzman 

[Application](https://airtable.com/shrsWGhjsdy5r8o7j) is now open until May 20th, 2020  
 
This workshop offers a combination of practical writing and critical thinking skills. Enrollment is open to anyone including artists, designers, creative technologists, engineers, architects, and others whose practices are difficult to define.  

Much like a user guide helps non-technical readers understand a system, an artist statement introduces an unfamiliar audience to the artist’s practice and informs them about the references, questions, and thought processes behind the artist’s work. We will consider the artist statement as a practical communication tool (for grant and residency applications) as well as a more intimate map for guiding the direction and values of one’s practice. 

Students will:
- give thoughtful presentations of their own work and feedback to others
- participate in writing exercises and one-on-one editorial meetings
- read and discuss texts written by artists
- engage in group discussions about the challenges of maintaining an honest practice
- imagine alternatives to capitalist institutions as the context for our creative work

The instructor, Celine Katzman, will offer her guidance as a curator and writer who is committed to supporting artists and creative practitioners engaged with new technologies. By the end of the workshop, students will cultivate clear and compelling artist statements which will be published in a collection on the SFPC are.na.

# Student testimonials

“Celine’s Artist Statement workshop gave me invaluable feedback on crafting an artist’s statement that could ground my work for applications for exhibition, residencies, teaching opportunities, and more. Beyond that, studying with Celine helped me articulate my practice to myself, and I return to that piece of writing often for guidance as I continue to adapt and develop my practice. This class is not only about learning to explain your work to institutions, but also about envisioning your practice for yourself.” Galen MacDonald

“Celine’s artist statement workshop stuck with me because it was less about producing the perfect artist statement, but instead critically reflecting on what you have done and where you want to go with your artistic practice. She was supportive in understanding my non-art background while at the same time, productively challenging my ideas.” Mark Anthony Hernandez

“Celine's mentoring motivated me to consider professional and personal values in making art. She guided me in writing an artist statement that clarified the ideas that I want to pursue with my work and that also correlates to broader concepts I want to explore within my practice.” Vivienne La

“Celine’s workshops guided us through the daunting, yet rewarding task of articulating the ideas behind our work. Our one-on-one meetings helped me contextualize my practice alongside everything else I learned at SFPC.” Danny Garfield

# Syllabus

Class 1 - Orientation + “What is an artist statement?”: We will introduce ourselves and review the course objectives and structure. Then, we will begin deconstructing “the artist statement.”


Class 2 - Mobile Studio Visits: Each student will give a brief presentation of their own work, followed by group feedback. 

Class 3 - Artist Writings + Visiting Artist Ryan Kuo: We will review and discuss a selection of texts written by artists. Ryan Kuo will give a presentation.

Class 4 - Collective Feedback: We will read artist statements out loud to each other “in a circle,” allowing time for productive feedback, reflection, and congratulations.

Class 5 - Publishing + What’s next?: We will decide on a format and design for the class publication. We will brainstorm what artists can offer to our communities, the public, and struggling institutions during this difficult period.
