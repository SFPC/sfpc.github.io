# Upcoming Programs

Subscribe to our mailing list, at the bottom of the page to be the first to hear about our upcoming programs. We are working on 2020 academic calendar. Please follow our social media and mailing list for the updates.

## Winter 2019

#### Code Movement, [learn more](https://sfpc.io/classes/movement).
- Led by movement teacher, performer, bodyworker, and writer Cori Kresge, this class will look at code as a resource, applying it to dance practices and community. We will focus on interpreting and creating systems of coding, scoring, and encrypting, using the body’s senses, gestures, and mechanics both individually and collectively. Together, we will cultivate practices that attempt to override the ego constructs that often obstruct or inhibit our learning and creativity.  
- Nov. 10, 17, 24, & Dec. 1; 1-4PM

#### Code Societies, [learn more](https://sfpc.io/codesocieties2020/)
- We will challenge the division between those who code software and those who are coded by it.  We will examine how code and societies shape and are shaped by each other by building new codes made of the the digital, the social, and the ritual, on a foundation of shared experience and a commitment to learning with care together.
- This session will run in the evening from 6:30pm - 9:30pm from January 6th - January 25th, 2020



# Past Programs

[Spring 2019](https://sfpc.io/fall2019/) March 4th - May 17th, 2019. Our immersive 10-week program covering programming, electronics, and the history and theory of art and technology.

[Code Paper Scissors](https://sfpc.io/codepaper), a two-Week Session exploring the wide variety of ways that a piece of paper can produce function. Lead by paper engineer/designer Kelli Anderson and origami artist/developer Robby Kraft. February 4th - February 17th, 2019 with evening classes from 6:30pm - 9:30pm.

[Code Societies Winter 2019](https://sfpc.io/codesocieties-winter-19) examines the ideological and corporeal attributes of computation; concentrating on the poetics and politics of culturally embedded software. How do different platforms and processes — including algorithms, data collection, social media, infrastructure, and interface — yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, feeling, and reinforce existing systems of power? Through a balanced study of critical theory discussion and hands-on coding workshops, students will create small projects that explore and question these ideas. Three-Week Session, January 7th - January 26th

- [New York Tech Zine Fair](http://techzinefair.org) December 1, 2018.

- [Code Words](http://sfpc.io/codewords) July 29 - August 3, 2018. A one-week session exploring how computation relates to language and art, focusing on literary art and poetry. 

- [Code Societies](http://sfpc.io/codesocieties) July 2nd - Saturday July 21st, 2018. Code Societies examines the ideological and mythological attributes of computation, concentrating on the poetics and politics of culturally embedded software.

- [Uncomputable](http://sfpc.io/uncomputable/) June 20th and June 28th, 2018. A series of lectures and exhibition by Alexander R. Galloway and Taeyoon Choi.



### What is the School for Poetic Computation?

School for Poetic Computation (SFPC) is a hybrid of school, artist residency and research group where students develop a deep curiosity of what it means to work poetically in computational media. SFPC [began](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/code-to-joy-the-school-for-poetic-computation-opens/?_r=0) as a school run by artists for artists. In the past we have held a combinations of two-week and ten-week intensive sessions.

SFPC is not a technical bootcamp, it is an opportunity to work with a group of faculty, visiting artists, and peers to focus on exploring artistic practice through computation. Computation is poetic when technology is used for critical thinking and aesthetic inquiry – a space where logic meets electricity (hardware), math meets language (software) and analytical thinking meets creative experimentation (theory).

[This article](http://www.creativeapplications.net/education/teaching-and-learning-at-sfpc-conversation-with-allison-parrish-and-surya-mattu/) featuring two teachers provides more insight on what teaching and learning feels like at SFPC or you can check out some of the student's blogs from previous sessions: [Yeseul](http://ysfpc.tumblr.com), [Chris](http://sfpchris.tumblr.com/), [Toru](http://sfpctoruurakawa.tumblr.com/), [Andy](http://sfpc-amd.tumblr.com/), [Sarah](http://sarahgp.com/writings/sfpc/other-two-questions.html) and [Robby](http://robbykraft.com/sfpc/).  Finally, our [FAQ](http://sfpc.io/faq/).

### Who are we looking for?

We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open. Anyone with a passion to explore poetic computation is invited and celebrate diversity in all forms. We expect that you are eager to experiment, learn from failure and come fully dedicated to this ten week experience meaning you will commit to engage with SFPC full-time.

In the past, we have had students with a broad array of technical experiences and we were delighted, though unsurprised, that everyone had something to learn from each other. A group of faculty leads a selection process that is based on applicant’s answers to an application form, work samples, and short interviews. Upon acceptance, a selection of reading and prep work will be assigned to you to complete prior to attending SFPC.

### What is expected of me?

Acceptance into the session is an invitation to join the SFPC community. Full-time participation during the ten weeks is mandatory. This also means you come prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and engage with the community. We expect our students to be in the school between 10am~5pm, Monday to Friday.

It’s also expected that you work openly – sharing what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. The success of the session for the group is dependent on engaged participation throughout the term. By participating you will be actively shaping an emerging culture of open source and transparent education.

### What are classes like?

SFPC’s main program takes place over ten weeks in New York City with daily classes that range from programming, electronics, and the history and theory of art and technology. There are student-led skill sharing sessions, lectures and workshops with visiting artists, visits to institutions, schools, art spaces and dinners with special guests.

We select up to 18 participants a session. Classes vary in length and are usually held Monday-Friday between 10am and 5pm. Students have full access to the space to work on projects between classes with teachers and mentors readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance. Peer to peer collaboration is highly encouraged among participant. We celebrate with a final student showcase where students get to share their projects with the larger SFPC community.


SFPC classes are typically structured around the following concepts: Computation and artistic practice, Language design as creative practice, Electronics and physical computing, Theory and philosophy for technology, and Code Poetry (Electronic literature and generatie poetry). The idea behind these interconnected topics is to build on SFPC’s core curriculum by exploring common ground where we can take the ideas developed in our classroom into the streets and studio. Check out [Call for Spring 2018](https://sfpc.io/spring2018) for a full listing of classes.

### How can I help SFPC?

We are actively seeking private, corporate and institutional support to open our door to more diverse students. If you are interested in sponsoring a student, email <info@sfpc.io>. We are able to receive tax-deductible donations through our fiscal sponsor.

### Where is SFPC?
We are located in 155 Bank Street, in the courtyard of the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village, New York City.
