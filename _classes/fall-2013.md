The Fall 2013 session ran for ten weeks at the Metropolitan Exchange on 33 Flatbush ave, Brooklyn. The first ever class was lead by four co-founders of SFPC: Zach Lieberman, Jen Lowe, Taeyoon Choi and Amit Pitaru, each teaching few classes. Additionally many inspiring colleagues were generous to come in for special lecture and talks. The ten weeks of exploration and collaboration were presented as a public exhibition with talks at Eyebeam Art and Technology Center in Manhattan.
