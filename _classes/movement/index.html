			The body is always listening, recording and computing. This movement-based class will take place over three three sessions at the School for Poetic Computation. 
		</span><br><br>
		<span class="sans">
			We will focus on the body’s innate ability to absorb information consciously through cognitive practice, and unconsciously through physical action and proprioception. We will look closely at how we learn with our bodies and what gets in the way. We will consider how creative bodily impulses are expressed and suppressed.

			<span class="serif-small">
				This class will be highly physical, pursuing a maximum sense of awareness in movement, while respecting and considering each person’s range of ability. Open to everyone. Disabled person is welcome to participate. Physical contact will be part of certain experiences with attention towards safety, respect, and care.<br><br>Each class will start with a simple warm up to activate body, senses, and space. Participants will be lead through varrious forms of movement research, improvisation, and repetition of phrases from dance repertory, drawing on some of Kresge’s experiences as a performer in works by Merce Cunningham, Liz Magic Laser, and Rashaun Mitchell + Silas Riener. Participants will develop, teach, and share their own movement sequences with each other in a laboratory setting. The 3rd and final class will culminate with brief presentations that express the participant’s own physical discoveries and may connect to other creative spheres or fields of research.
