	<h4>
		<span class="serif-bold-italic serif serif-med">
		Led by movement teacher, performer, bodyworker, and writer Cori Kresge, this class will look at code as a resource, applying it to dance practices and community. We will focus on interpreting and creating systems of coding, scoring, and encrypting, using the body’s senses, gestures, and mechanics both individually and collectively. Together, we will cultivate practices that attempt to override the ego constructs that often obstruct or inhibit our learning and creativity.



		</span><br><br>
 	
		 <span class="sans">
			The emergent movement will be examined as a language that can be developed, organized, and reorganized in time and space. By engaging in practices of repetition, variation, and manipulation, we can effectively reveal meaning or encrypt meaning in action. Through in-class activities and assignments, we will interpret and create scores, patterns, and codes with our physical actions and gestures.

			Notes from the instructor: This class will be highly physical, pursuing a maximal sense of awareness in movement, while respecting and considering each person’s range of ability. Open to everyone. Disabled persons are welcome to participate. Physical contact will be part of certain experiences with attention towards safety, respect, and care.

				<br> <br> 

				Each class will start with a simple warm up to activate body, senses, and space. Participants will be lead through various forms of movement research, improvisation, and repetition of phrases from dance repertoire, drawing on some of Kresge’s experiences as a performer in works by Merce Cunningham, Liz Magic Laser, Rashaun Mitchell, Silas Riener, and others. Participants will develop, teach, and share their own movement sequences with each other in a laboratory setting.  
				<br><br>  
				The final class will culminate with brief presentations that express the participant’s own physical discoveries and may connect to other creative spheres or fields of research.
