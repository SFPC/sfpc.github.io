## Call for Students: Code Societies
- Three-Week Session, Monday January 7th - Saturday January 26th
- SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC
- 6:30pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes
- **Applications are now closed**


SFPC’s Code Societies, our winter intensive session, will examine the ideological and corporeal attributes of computation; concentrating on the poetics and politics of culturally embedded software. How do different platforms and processes — including algorithms, data collection, social media, infrastructure, and interface — yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, feeling, and reinforce existing systems of power? Through a balanced study of critical theory discussion and hands-on coding workshops, students will create small projects that explore and question these ideas.

No coding experience necessary; only enthusiasm and willingness to reconsider how code shapes and is shaped by society. The session will begin with a brief introduction to programming with Python and navigating the command line.

Central to Code Societies is understanding technology as culture and culture as social technology. Students are encouraged to engage with code and the ways code acts on our bodies and networks equally as subject and as medium. Code Societies is both this session’s subject and it’s prompt; an invitation to consider coding and choreographing new ways of being in relation with each other.
Student’s should expect to develop several small scores or sketch pieces that may exist online, on screens, be performed, or installed.


### Who are the teachers?
- [**Melanie Hoff**](http://melanie-hoff.com/) (*2 Classes - Lead Organizer, On-Site Support*) - Artist and educator examining the role technology plays in social organization and reinforcing hegemonic structures. They write software, create experimental workshops, and teach at Rutgers University, the School for Poetic Computation, and are a founding member of the Cybernetics Library.
- [**Allison Parrish**](http://www.decontextualize.com/) (*2 Classes*) - Allison is a computer programmer, poet, educator and game designer whose teaching and practice address the unusual phenomena that blossom when language and computers meet. She teaches at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program.
- [**Ingrid Burrington**](lifewinning.com) (*2 Classes*) - Ingrid Burrington writes, makes maps, and tells jokes about places, politics, and the feelings people have about both.

Her work has been supported by Eyebeam, Data & Society, and the Center for Land Use Interpretation.
- [**American Artist**](https://americanartist.us/) (*1 Class*) - American is an interdisciplinary artist whose work extends dialectics formalized in Black radicalism and organized labor into a context of networked virtual life. Their practice makes use of video, installation, new media, and writing to reveal historical dynamics embedded within contemporary culture and technology.
- [**Taeyoon Choi**](http://taeyoonchoi.com/) (*1 Class, Session Advisor*) - Taeyoon is an artist, a co-founder of School for Poetic Computation, a former fellow at Data and Society and an adjunct professor at NYU ITP. In 2018, Taeyoon is working on [Distributed Web of Care](http://taeyoonchoi.com/soft-care/distributed-web-of-care/) and ongoing research with a critical perspective towards technology, ethics, justice and sensitivity to the concept of personhood.
- [**Everest Pipkin**](http://www.decontextualize.com/) (*1 Class*) - Everest is a drawing, language and software artist whose work follows landscape as complicated by the advent of digital space. They produce intimate work with large data sets.
- [**Dan Taeyoung**](http://www.dantaeyoung.com/) (*1 Class*) - Dan is a designer, researcher, and a teacher. He is interested in how cooperative practices and spatial environments change the way we think, collaborate, and learn with each other. He teaches at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation at Columbia University.
- [**Nora Khan**](http://www.noranahidkhan.com/) (*1 Class*) - Nora Khan is a writer. Her criticism focuses on digital visual culture, the philosophy of emerging technology, and experimental art and music practices that make arguments through software. She is on the Digital and Media faculty at Rhode Island School of Design, where she teaches several courses: critical theory and artistic research, critical writing about art and technology, and history of media art. She is a longtime editor at Rhizome, an editor of Prototype, a book for Google’s Artist and Machine Intelligence group, and has published in *4Columns, Rhizome, Art in America, Flash Art, Mousse, California Sunday, Spike Art, The Village Voice, Glass Bead*, and many other places.
- **FlucT** (*1 Class*) - FlucT is the collaborative work of two artists, Sigrid Lauren and Monica Mirabile, who address issues in the capital obedience of American culture through choreography and performance. Creating original narrative soundscapes linking a manipulated pop music psychosis with violently intimate dance, their composition is a projection driven to expose the psychology of this social paradigm. FlucT’s work has been widely reviewed and they founded Otion Front Studio, a performance/dance space in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. [Sigrid Lauren](http://www.sigridlauren.com/fluct/) & [Monica Mirabile](http://www.monicamirabile.com/fluct-1/)
- [**BuFu**](http://www.bufubyusforus.com/) (*1 Class*) - Bufu is a collaborative living archive centered around (pan)black and (pan)asian cultural and political relationships. We, the founders of this project, are a collective of queer, femme and non-binary, black and east-asian artists and organizers. Our goal is to facilitate a global conversation on the relationship between black and asian diasporas, with an emphasis on building solidarity, de-centering whiteness, and resurfacing our deeply interconnected and complicated histories. We attempt to achieve this through our collaborative programming, our visual archives, and through building long-term partnerships with collectives, organizations, and individuals.


- 15 class days in total with a final presentation. More teachers and speakers to be announced!

### How do I apply?
**Applications are now closed**

We accept up to 18 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within 3 weeks of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!

### How competitive is the admissions?

SFPC admissions is highly competitive. Every session, we receive up to 80 applicants and select 18. We focus on creating diversity among our student body. We work with a group of alumni and teachers to review and select students based on their work samples and essays.

### How much is tuition?
$3,000 USD for the 3-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $800 - $1400). Upon acceptance, payment of full tuition, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible.

### Do you offer scholarship?

We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. In Code Societies, we are offering three work-study opportunity to a qualified applicant who would be expected to work 5 hrs/week in exchange for a 50% reduction of tuition.  We’re particularly looking out for women, people of color, disabled person, people under-represented in the field of art + technology, and those with financial need.

Please note that if you apply for work study, we will consider your application separately from the general admissions applications, since we have little flexibility regarding scholarships. This is for people who absolutely need assistance to participate in SFPC. Occasionally, students have received support from cultural foundations, schools or current employers and we are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance.

### Cancellation and refund policy

- If you are accepted and need to cancel, we can give you 100% refund up to December 15th, 2018.
- 50% refund between December 15th – December 31st, 2018.
- 25% refund between January 1st – January 6th, 2018.
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class.
- Participation is not transferrable to another person.


### What is expected of me?

- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)
