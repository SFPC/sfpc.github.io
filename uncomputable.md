## Uncomputable


According to digital philosophers, the world is a computer and everything inside it is computable. But is this entirely true? What about things that fall outside the bounds of the computable? Alan Turing demonstrated that there are kinds of problems that are computable and kinds of problems that are not, providing a theoretical answer to the question of the uncomputable. But there is also a practical answer: how many computer cycles do you have at your disposal? If you want to crack high-grade encryption, can you afford to crunch the numbers until the sun burns out? In this project we will explore the realm of the uncomputable. In the digital realm the uncomputable appears in logical paradoxes and rational incompleteness. In the analog realm the uncomputable consists of all those things that remain ungovernable, unspeakable, or unseeable. Come explore with us the binary present, and the non-binary future. Come explore the uncomputable.

Uncomputable consists of lectures by Alexander R. Galloway on June 20th and June 28th, 6~9pm and an exhibition by Taeyoon Choi that will be open to the public between June 20th and 28th. Uncomputable is made possible with the support of The Department of Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University, Data and Society Research Institute and the School for Poetic Computation.

### Paintings

*Analog* by Taeyoon Choi, 48 * 62 inches, Acrylics on canvas.

Ekphrastic poetry by [Nick Montfort](https://nickm.com/)

Ludwig Wittgenstein writes at the end of the Tractatus that the comprehending reader “must, so to
speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.” Wittgenstein’s ladder, along with a small
staircase of four steps and a connected series of ramps are all thrown away here, small rectilinear forms in space. <!--more--> Paint has otherwise been applied in smooth rotations, some of it — of day and thin cloud — placed atop broader strokes — of night and its hard, abrupt pathways. Smoothed bristles are felt everywhere. In a few places, the paint has narrowly dripped down, following gravity’s desire, a force that also must be gripping the discarded ladder.

*Digital* by Taeyoon Choi, 48 * 62 inches, Acrylics on canvas.
Ekphrastic poetry by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com)

Stratiform precipitation and fog, white fur and black leather belt and boots, stick and ball, the neck and round ears; parks and public spaces, homes or public buildings. Conversely many original church buildings, the letter m; the first letter, a black bear on white background to a white bear on black background; deep red to pink. Vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black. Sperm with eggs, eggs or milk. Small decals or imitation crab meat. Hinges to a frame, a pantograph sliding on an overhead line, a road through the wilderness, the river shark, the lower jaw, long bony tails; bronze or stone milestones. The finger or the middle finger, four fingers plus one thumb; the thumb roll. A different line or space dust; outer space or the ground.

### Cybernetics Library

The [Cybernetics Library](https://cybernetics.social/library/) is: Sarah Hamerman, David Isaac Hecht, Dan Taeyoung, Charles Eppley, Sam Hart, Melanie Hoff. The Cybernetics Library is an interdisciplinary browsing library that re-contextualizes the expansive history of cybernetic thought and practice. Unexpected connections between art, technology, and society are facilitated from a contemporary vantage. The Cybernetics Library collects and re-codes texts and ideas across various fields of inquiry in order to reposition cybernetics as a generative approach to understanding how we are embedded in pervasive technological systems. Furthermore, the library considers issues of ethics and bias within technological systems, asking how we might create possibilities to critique and affect those systems. The Cybernetics Library is structured as a collective organization that builds upon it’s members’ wide-ranging research interests. Through its continually evolving collection and technological components, the library aims to generate feedback between publications, digital information, physical installations, and the readers themselves. The Cybernetics Library is presening a [special collection](https://www.librarything.com/catalog/CyberneticsCon/uncomputable) for Uncomputable.
