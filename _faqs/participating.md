### Do I need programming skills to be accepted?

For participating in our 10 Weeks program, we encourage students to have some familiarity with programming and technology in general. If you are an absolute beginner, there will be assignments prior to the School that will get you familiar with the medium. Many of the online classes are open to people without prior experience. We offer Creative Coding Bootcamp for those who are interested in learing code for the first time. 

### Where do I apply?

Check the Call for Students in the "[Participate](/participate)" section of our website.

### How long is a session?

We offer 1-day Workshops, Part Time Intensive and Ten-Weeks: Full Time Immersive sessions in our NYC location. We are offering a variety of online, remote classes in 2020 for the first time. 

### Can non-US citizens apply?

Yes. The 10 weeks session accommodates international students visiting with visitor visas.

### How can I find out about future sessions?

Due to the COVID-19 outbreaks, the School for Poetic Computation is offering classes for online, remote learning for the first time. Please check out our [Participate](/participate) page. 

### Do you have a Code of Conduct?

Yes, we have a working [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SFPC/codeofconduct) which we adapt to specific courses in collaboration with teachers and students. We are indepted to many of our friends and mentors for the Code of Conduct, including Babycastles and BUFU, who helped us become a more welcoming space for diverse communities.

### Is your class accessible for disabled students?

We aim to be an inclusive and accessible for the disabled and Deaf community. Our classes are not fully accessible at the moment. In the past, we worked with American Sign Language Interpreters and Visual Interpreters, as well as accessibility and disability rights organizations to make our classes more inclusive. If you have any access needs, please email [info@sfpc.io](mailto:info@sfpc.io). 

### Will you ever come teach in my city? 

We've done a few remote programs, namely in [Detroit](/detroit) and [Yamaguchi](https://github.com/SFPC/yamaguchi-2019) as well as exhibitions in Houston, San Francisco, and Barcelona. In order to plan a remote program, we need to have an institutional partner who are willing to support the project. Due to the COVID-19, we are focusing on online programs at the moment.   

### Will you offer 10-Weeks session in NYC this Fall or next year? 

We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 and following all Federal, state, and local guidance regarding COVID-19 procedures. We are hoping to make a decision about fall sessions by late June. At the moment, we are committed to providing online classes for our community.
