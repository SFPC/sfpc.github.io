## Call for Students: Code Narratives
- Two-Week Session, Monday July 10th - Saturday July 22nd
- @ SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC
- 7pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes
- Apply [**here!**](https://goo.gl/forms/dqGHGq6mijVgLzis2)


SFPC's Summer Intensive: Code Narratives will explore the practice of generative writing using [Python](https://www.python.org/). We will start by collecting source texts as the fuel for our generators, and learn how to parse them for the parts we want most using language processing techniques. Once we have our source material, we will experiment with our writing machines in a variety of narrative forms like screenplays, twitter bots, and multimedia works. Students will create several small generative text projects over the course of the session and finish with a prototype of something larger, with opportunities to show work to the larger SFPC community toward the end. No coding experience required, all levels welcome.

### What will happen in these two weeks?
Classes are held in the evenings Monday-Friday from 7-9:30pm and the session will culminate in a party on the afternoon of Saturday July 22nd,  where students can invite their friends and present their favorite generative projects.

Students will have full access to the space for the two weeks of the session to work on projects between classes and mentors wil be readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance. Read our [Participate page](http://sfpc.io/participate/) for more information.

### How do I apply?
You can apply to this session [**here.**](https://goo.gl/forms/dqGHGq6mijVgLzis2)

We accept up to 15 students on a rolling basis. We will respond to your application within ~1 week of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!

### How much is tuition?
$1,500 USD for the 2-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $800 - $1400). Upon payment, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible. Unfortunately, due to small size of the overall budget, we can't provide scholarship for intensive program. In the past, students were able to get help from their employer or school to cover the cost. Upon acceptance, SFPC can provide an invitation letter for you.


### What if I can’t go, can I get a refund?
- Yes, we can give you 100% refund up to 5 days before class starts
- 50% refund after 5 days, until the first day of class
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class

### What is expected of me?
- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)

### Where is SFPC?
We are located at 155 Bank Street, in the courtyard of the Westbeth Artists' Community in Manhattan's West Village, New York City.
