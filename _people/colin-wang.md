Colin Wang is an artist from San Francisco, constantly seeking shifts in perception and perspective through interactive experiences. His work is informed by a background in mechanical engineering and manifests in physical spaces and objects, while also engaging other disciplines and mediums, specifically computation and digital media. Throughout all this, he maintains a focus on teaching and education, as an instructor in formal settings, and through the affordances in his work. As the founder and director of the Aver Collective he pushes for collaboration in process, exhibition, and reflection.
