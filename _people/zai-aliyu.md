Zai is a designer/artist/cultural worker who seeks to use speculative storytelling and thoughtful interventions to catalyze resilience, resistance and radical hope within communities. She interrogates societal cybernetics and dreams through installations, virtual environments, archives, poetry, printed matter, and community-participatory (de)programming.
