## Call for Students: Spring '19 New Coders Bootcamp
- One Week, Monday March 4th - Friday March 8th
- @ SFPC, 155 Bank street, West Village, NYC
- 10am - 1pm, Morning Classes with optional afternoon working sessions
- [Apply Now!](https://airtable.com/shr4DF0I48cpZB9Le) - deadline is February 20th, 2019

School for Poetic Computation’s Bootcamp introduces the foundations of coding to beginners by creating visual art and animations in openFrameworks. This 5 day session will be open both to incoming SFPC students and anyone who wants to learn to code. The bootcamp will be taught by Matt Jacobson and Robby Kraft.

During this week students will be coding in C++, learning concepts like variables, memory, and scope; branching, looping, boolean evaluations, and logic; functions, recursion, and events; object-oriented design; and working with media like video, sound, and responding to keyboard and mouse inputs. Students will become competent in Xcode/Visual Studio, GitHub, and openFrameworks.

### Who are the teachers?
- [Matt Jacobson](http://iammattjacobson.com/) - is a statistician and recreational mathematician based in New York City.
- [Robby Kraft](http://robbykraft.com/) - is an origami artist, educator, and software engineer based in New York City.

### Schedule

#### Day 1
- introduction to code as a medium for creation, different languages and their benefits.
- introduction to Xcode/VisualStudio, Github, the openFrameworks ecosystem, and the C++ build system.
- C++ code syntax, OpenGL coordinate system
- Processing, openFrameworks, Arduino design paradigm: `setup()` and `draw()`
- simple graphics drawing primitives
- introduction to variables, computer memory, types, scope, and functions.

#### Day 2
- functions that return values
- openFrameworks utility methods, random numbers, time, using sine curves
- animation and changing states
- control structures: branching and looping
- event handlers: mouse and keyboard

#### Day 3
- container data structures
- object-oriented design
- classes, methods, properties, and states
- ofPoint and other openFrameworks primitives

#### Day 4
- more openFrameworks object types: polylines, vectors, cameras
- ofxAddons, community extensions to openFrameworks
- transformations
  - rotate, translate scale
  - push, pop matrices
- function recursion

#### Day 5
- C++ standard library types
- reading and writing data
- displaying images, playing audio, capturing video
- classwork and examples in other programming languages


### What will happen during this one-week bootcamp?
Classes are held in the morning Monday-Friday from 10am-1pm. After class, the space will be open and teachers will be around to help with any of the assignments and questions you may have.

SFPC fosters a collaborative and relaxed learning environment. We value your questions and want to make sure all students feel comfortable engaging with the teachers and material fully.  Read our <a href="/participate/"> Participate </a> page for more information on what our classes feel like.

### How much is tuition?
$500 USD for the 1-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $500 - $1000). Upon payment, your space in the class will be reserved.

We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. In the spirit of radical openness and generosity, on which the school was founded, [we open-source our finances on Github](https://github.com/sfpc/finance-and-administration). There, you can read financial reports and download raw statements.

### What if I can't go, can I get a refund?
- Yes, we can give you 100% refund up to 5 days before class starts
- 50% refund after 5 days, until the first day of class
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class


### What is expected of me?
- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences--no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)
