The NYTZF is an event for the tech zine publishing community, providing an accessible platform for artists, designers, engineers and DIY publishers to connect with audiences and circulate their work in a supportive community.

Over two days, the NYTZF 2018 will welcome 20 exhibitors including computer comic artists, grassroots activist, collectives, independent publishers, and academic institutions.
