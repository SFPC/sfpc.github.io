School for Poetic Computation(SFPC)’s winter intensive is an introduction to re-introducing yourselves to computers. How do different platforms and processes—including algorithms, surveillance, social media, infrastructure, and interface—yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, feeling, and reinforce existing systems of power? We will examine how code and societies shape and are shaped by each other by building new codes made of the social, the digital, and the ritual, on a foundation of shared experience and a commitment to learning with care together. Code Societies is about redrawing the divisions that make us and unmake us; and we’ll begin by challenging the division between those who code software and those who are coded by it.

No coding experience necessary: This session centers the learning experience of beginner programmers while simultaneously taking the position that everyone who interacts with computers has—in important ways—always already been programming them.[^1]

Through a balanced, interwoven study of critical theory and hands-on coding workshops, students should expect to develop several small scores or sketch pieces that may exist online, on screens, performed, or installed. We’ll cover foundational methods of coding with Python, coding on the web, navigating the command line, and working with zines as a technology to name a few. The classes are held in the evenings and are designed to engage with code, and the ways code acts on our bodies and networks, equally as subject and as medium. Code Societies is both this session’s subject and it’s prompt; it is an invitation to consider coding and choreographing new ways of being with each other within the unique learning environment of SFPC.

We will work together to create boundaries that make it easier for everyone involved to feel as safe and comfortable as possible throughout the session without intentional harm or discrimination done onto them, which will not be tolerated. SFPC is a school organized by people who are committed to making space for people who exist at the intersections of perceived and oppressed identities, including but not limited to, those who are queer and trans people of color; disabled; deaf or hard of hearing. Code Societies is a program which studies the very systems that create barriers to spaces of technology and learning and acknowledges  the process of ideological confrontation can sometimes feel uncomfortable. We understand safety is relative and in constant negotiation, especially at the margins. We also distinguish safety from discomfort, as there is no such thing as a never uncomfortable space.[^2] Read more about the SFPC code of conduct [here](https://github.com/SFPC/codeofconduct).

## The Stewards of Code Societies

**[Melanie Hoff](https://melanie-hoff.com/) (Lead Organizer)** is an artist and educator examining the role technology plays in social organization and reinforcing hegemonic structures. Their work uncovers coded conventions of norms, interfaces, and sex, through software, installation, and new choreographies of exchange. They are a founding member of the [Cybernetics Library](http://cybernetics.social), an art and research collective offering resources for study and critique of technosocial systems and [Soft Surplus](https://www.instagram.com/softsurplus), a collective art studio warehouse for learning together by making things near each other. They teach at teach at the Rhode Island School of Design, SFPC, and have presented their work at the Tate Exchange London, the New Museum, the Queens Museum, The Internet Archive, Pioneer Works, and elsewhere.

**[Neta Bomani](https://www.netabomani.com/) (Assistant Organizer)** is a worker who engages in visual storytelling, direct action and anti art practices through organizing and making archives, writings, prints, zines, circuits and workshops. Neta's work has materialized as an educator of the Pioneer Works collaboration with Good Shepherds after school programs, a steward of the School for Poetic Computation, a member of Stephanie Dinkins Studio and a participator in grassroots organizing against prisons and borders in New York City and beyond in solidarity with No New Jails, Take Back the Bronx and more.

**[Emma Rae Norton](https://www.marceldochamp.net/) (Assistant Organizer)** is an artist working with and through software. Her work, while mostly existing online, has appeared in the form of DAT zines, CD-ROM and collaborative hand coding workshops. Emma is committed to unpacking the ubiquitous networked and computational world that she lives in through a research-based art practice. Her current research focuses on the computer mouse as an impactful technological object — most recently taking the form of writing, the co-organization of a computer mouse conference, and scrolling lectures.

**[Taeyoon Choi](http://taeyoonchoi.com/) (Session Advisor)** is an artist, writer, and a co-founder of SFPC. He works on accessibile and inclusive art and technology education. He works for disability rights and environmental justice. He collaborates with various artists and engineers on the Distributed Web of Care.

### Student Quotes

>“This experience was comparable to reading a book that jars me ideologically, changes my conception of possibility, and gives me a new framework for approaching the experience of being a person with a body in a place.” - Mimi Doan after FlucT’s class during Code Societies 2019

>“For me Code Societies was an entanglement of ideas, movement and metaphor […] we listened to each other, moved our bodies through space, and shared with each other ways of seeing the world and ourselves.” - Emma Rae Norton from their project, A collaborative Archive of Code Societies Ephemera, 2019


### What will happen in these three weeks?
Classes are held in the evenings Monday-Friday from 6:30-9:30pm with a day off on Martin Luther King Day January 21st. SFPC space will be open for students on weekdays between 3:30pm-6pm. The session will culminate in a party on the evening of Saturday January 25th, where students can invite their friends and present their projects and reflections.

Students will have full access to the space during open hours for the three weeks of the session to work on projects between classes and mentors will be readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance.


### How do I apply?
**Applications are now Open**<br>
⤳ **[Apply Here](https://airtable.com/shrbFALyK5MRnXpP1)**

We accept up to 18 students on a rolling basis until **Monday, December 1st**. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early! We will respond to your application within 3 weeks of submission.

### How competitive is the admissions?

SFPC admissions is highly competitive. Every session, we receive up to 80 applicants and select 18. We focus on creating diversity among our student body. We work with a group of alumni and teachers to review and select students based on their work samples and essays.

### How much is tuition?
$3,000 USD for the 3-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $800 - $1400). Upon acceptance, payment of full tuition, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible.

### Do you offer scholarship?

We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. In Code Societies, we are offering three work-study opportunity to a qualified applicant who would be expected to work 5 hrs/week in exchange for a 50% reduction of tuition.  We’re particularly looking out for women, people of color, disabled person, people under-represented in the field of art + technology, and those with financial need.

Please note that if you apply for work study, we will consider your application separately from the general admissions applications, since we have little flexibility regarding scholarships. This is for people who absolutely need assistance to participate in SFPC. Occasionally, students have received support from cultural foundations, schools or current employers and we are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance.

### Cancellation and refund policy

- If you are accepted and need to cancel, we can give you 100% refund up to December 15th, 2019.
- 50% refund between December 15th – December 25th, 2020.
- 25% refund between December 25th – January 3rd, 2020.
- No refunds can be given after January 3rd, 2020.
- Participation is not transferrable to another person.


### What is expected of me?

- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)
