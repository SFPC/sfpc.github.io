## Call for Students: Code Societies
- Three-Week Session, Monday January 6th - Saturday January 25th
- SFPC, 155 Bank Street, West Village, NYC
- 6:30pm - 9:30pm, Evening Classes
- **[Apply Here]()**


Code Societies is an introduction to re-introducing yourselves to computers. SFPC’s winter intensive will examine how code and societies shape and are shaped by each other. We will build new kinds of codes made of the social, the digital, and the ritual, on a foundation of shared experience and a commitment to learning with care together. Through a balanced, interwoven study of critical theory and hands-on coding workshops, students will create small projects that explore and question these ideas. We’ll cover foundational methods of coding with Python, coding on the web, navigating the command line, and working with zines as a technology to name a few. The classes are held in the evenings and are designed to engage with code, and the ways code acts on our bodies and networks, equally as subject and as medium.

Code Societies is about redrawing the divisions that make us and unmake us; and we’ll begin by challenging the division between those who code software and those who are coded by it. This session centers the learning experience of beginner programmers while simultaneously taking the position that everyone who interacts with computers has—in important ways—always already been programming them.

How do different platforms and processes—including algorithms, surveillance, social media, infrastructure, and interface—yield distinct modes of seeing, thinking, feeling, and reinforce existing systems of power? Through a balanced study of critical theory, and hands-on coding workshops student’s should expect to develop several small scores or sketch pieces that may exist online, on screens, performed, or installed.

Code Societies is both this session’s subject and it’s prompt; it is an invitation to consider coding and choreographing new ways of being in relation with each other within the unique learning environment of SFPC.

SFPC is a school organized by people who are committed to making space for people who exist at the intersections of percieved and oppressed identities, including but not limited to, those who are queer and trans people of color; disabled; deaf or hard of hearing. We understand safety is relative and in constant negotiation, especially at the margins. We also distinguish safety from discomfort, as there is no such thing as a never uncomfortable space.[^1] Code Societies is a program which studies the very systems that create such barriers to space. Because the process of ideological confrontation can be uncomfortable, we will work together to create boundaries that make it easier for everyone involved to feel as safe and comfortable as possible throughout the process without intentional harm or discrimination done onto them, which will not be tolerated. Read more about the SFPC code of conduct [here](https://github.com/SFPC/codeofconduct).

No coding experience necessary; an enthusiastic willingness to reconsider how code shapes and is shaped by society required!

**14 class days in total with a Student Showcase presentation on January 25th. Code Societies 2020 teachers and to be announced!**

### Classes taught in Code Societies Winter 2019:

**Nabil Hassein & Melanie Hoff taught [Computational Methods of Code Societies](http://sfpc.io/codesocieties-winter-19/2019/01/08/computational-methods-of-code-societies.html)**<br>
An introduction to developing an intentional relationship between yourself as the the programmer, your computer, and the environments you create together. We wrote folder poetry in the command line, coded socially with Github, and processed language with Python.

**Melanie Hoff taught [Cybernetics of Sex: Technology, Feminism(s), and the Choreography of Culture]()**<br>

**BUFU taught [WYFY: Exorcizing Technology]()**<br>
We Went on a journey to rethink building more equitable spaces IRL/URL and participated in meditative exercises to exorcize technology.
<br>⤳ [Blog Post](http://sfpc.io/codesocieties-winter-19/2019/01/12/wyfy-exorcizing-technology.html)

**Dan Taeyoung taught [Ethicsware]()**<br>
We asked what is intimate software, created by us, only for us, that debates with our ethical selves? We used Python to create software that debates and disputes, rather than fulfills our desires.
<br>⤳ [Blog Post](http://sfpc.io/codesocieties-winter-19/2019/01/15/ethicsware.html)

**Nora Khan taught [Critical Simulation]()**<br>
We rethought techno-utopian ideals of neutrality that perpetuates the idea of a “just world” which assumes a flat plane of opportunity. Together we imagined alternative simulations of collective futures we wanted to be a part of.
<br>⤳ [Blog Post](http://sfpc.io/codesocieties-winter-19/2019/01/30/critical-simulation.html)

**FlucT taught [We Play Programmed]()**<br>
An embodied workshop and performance about performance both as art and behavior. We explored how behaviors are prioritized by social programming, whether by poetry or by survival.
<br>⤳ [Blog Post](http://sfpc.io/codesocieties-winter-19/2019/01/18/we-play-programmed.html)

**Taeyoon Choi taught [Distributed Web of Care]()**<br>
Taeyoon prompted us to think about not simply decentralizing networks, but taking a step further to weave a distributed web of care. Through code, movement, and string we practiced an understanding of that which could not be verbalized.

### What will happen in these three weeks?
Classes are held in the evenings Monday-Friday from 6:30-9:30pm with a day off on Martin Luther King Day January 21st. SFPC space will be open for students on weekdays between 3:30pm-6pm. The session will culminate in a party on the evening of Saturday January 25th, where students can invite their friends and present their projects and reflections.

Students will have full access to the space during open hours for the three weeks of the session to work on projects between classes and mentors will be readily available for technical, conceptual, and artistic guidance.


### How do I apply?
**Applications are now closed**

We accept up to 18 students on a rolling basis until **Tuesday, December 2nd**. We will respond to your application within 3 weeks of submission. Rolling admissions means there are fewer and fewer slots the longer you wait, so if you’re interested in the program get your application in early!

### How competitive is the admissions?

SFPC admissions is highly competitive. Every session, we receive up to 80 applicants and select 18. We focus on creating diversity among our student body. We work with a group of alumni and teachers to review and select students based on their work samples and essays.

### How much is tuition?
$3,000 USD for the 3-week program. You’ll also need to cover your own cost of living, including housing and meals (recent alumni report this to be in the range of $800 - $1400). Upon acceptance, payment of full tuition, your space in the class will be reserved. SFPC tuition goes directly to paying for the teachers, organizers, materials and space that make sessions like this possible.

### Do you offer scholarship?

We are completely self-funded, which dramatically limits our ability to offer scholarships. In Code Societies, we are offering three work-study opportunity to a qualified applicant who would be expected to work 5 hrs/week in exchange for a 50% reduction of tuition.  We’re particularly looking out for women, people of color, disabled person, people under-represented in the field of art + technology, and those with financial need.

Please note that if you apply for work study, we will consider your application separately from the general admissions applications, since we have little flexibility regarding scholarships. This is for people who absolutely need assistance to participate in SFPC. Occasionally, students have received support from cultural foundations, schools or current employers and we are happy to provide supporting materials as proof of acceptance.

### Cancellation and refund policy

- If you are accepted and need to cancel, we can give you 100% refund up to December 15th, 2018.
- 50% refund between December 15th – December 31st, 2018.
- 25% refund between January 1st – January 6th, 2018.
- No refunds can be given after the first day of class.
- Participation is not transferrable to another person.


### What is expected of me?

- Come to all classes and thoughtfully engage with your classmates and teachers.
- We are looking for autodidacts from all backgrounds who are curious, generous and open.
- We welcome students with a broad array of technical experiences–no coding experience is required, but a basic comfort level with technology is preferred.
- B.Y.O.Laptop (Mac / PC / Linux)


### Where is SFPC?

We are located at 155 Bank Street, in the courtyard of the Westbeth Artists' Community in Manhattan's West Village, New York City.
