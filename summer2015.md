## Summer Session on Code Poetry


We are organizing evening classes for a summer session on Code Poetry between July 27th - August 9th, 2015

School for Poetic Computation (SFPC) is a hybrid of school, artist residency and research group where students develop a deep curiosity of what it means to work poetically in computational media.

Poetic Computation is a practice and a community that sees the computer as a medium for artistic expression and critical thinking. It’s less impressed with the final result of the ‘thing’ and more supportive of the process, learnings and questions around creating the thing.

Now that most of our reading is mediated by technology, it makes sense to develop a writing practice that recognizes, even takes advantage of that fact. By using code you control the reader’s attention – where they dwell or skim – and create an emotional scene on which text resides. Code can also generate the content of text, a practice that has spawned some excellent twitter bots and generated novels.

This 2-week program is for artists, writers and poets who want to learn to code or push the boundaries of what’s possible with text – it’s also for coders and technologists who want to incorporate narrative and poetry into their work.

Come with a project in mind, a question you want to explore, or just an excitement to learn. We’ll work together to build upon ideas over the two weeks and share our projects with each other at the end of the session.

We will be primarily working with JavaScript and Python. You don’t need to know how to code in these languages but getting familiar with them will help you make the most of the program. We’re here to help you help yourself and we recommend completing a few online tutorials if you are beginner (resources below).

Meet others! Building a supportive community is important to SFPC. We’d love for you to join us for these two weeks but also to stay involved when they are done. We will do our best to introduce you to people and places that foster creativity and learning around the city.

## Dates & Logistics
Monday, July 27th - Sunday, August 9th @ Babycastles gallery

- Classes will be held between Mon-Fri from 6:30pm - 9:30pm with workshops and social events on the weekend.
- Additionally, the space will be open for students on weekdays for working, learning and hanging out. We encourage people with day jobs to attend this program and it is *not mandatory* to be there during the day, however if you can get away for a few days you can use this time to focus on your project and studies!

## Fees
- 1,500 USD to participate in two weeks program.
- We are committed to being fully transparent about how we make and spend money. In the spirit of radical openness and generosity, on which the school was founded, we open-source our finances on [Github](https://github.com/SFPC/finance-and-administration).
There, you can read financial reports and download raw statements.

## Deadline
Please apply **as soon as possible!** we have a limited space to accommodate participants. We will be accepting students on a rolling basis for the Summer session. This means early applicants will be notified sooner. Final deadline is 7.23, however there is a high chance we will close the call when we have 15 students who confirm acceptance.
