### Teaching as Art

- Date: Starting in June 19, 2020 for ten weeks. Saturdays 10am- 12pm EST  
- Teacher: Taeyoon Choi
- [Application](https://airtable.com/shrUFmByJeNnv0uAl) is now open until June 1st, 2020
 
Teaching as Art is for artists and technologists who want to teach. The class is also for teachers who want to advance their art and pedagogy. A good teacher is a great student themself. They transform their curiosity into knowledge and share their learning processes with others. One can learn to become a better teacher by staying fearless about ‘not knowing’ something, embracing radically open ideas and connecting various expertise and knowledge. Teaching can be a form of artistic and creative practice in collaboration with a diverse community. Teachers can invent new forms of learning spaces, new kinds of collaboration and new senses of community. Teachers and students can collaborate on art projects that connect social justice with creative practice. Teaching, learning and unlearning can be a way to make sense of the unsettling world, to build a web of care and accountability and create a micro-institutions for larger, social change.  

In this class, students will learn about applying creative processes to teaching. Students will read about the history of artists in and out of academic institutions, Black Mountain College, Socially Engaged Art, as well as more recent experiments in Alternative Education. Students are expected to participate in critical discussions about the topics, offer constructive feedback for each other and share teaching material. 

This class was offered at Interactive Telecommunications in New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts in 2017 and 2018 as well as the EYEO Festival in 2017. Students of the previous classes went on to become teaching artists in institutions such as MoMA, the New Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art, professors in various universities, and organizers of Afrotectopia, Computer Mouse Conference and more.

### Hear from the students

Anonymous testimonials from NYU students submitted to the course evaluations between 2017~2018. 

What aspects of this course were the most important or helpful to you? 

"All of it. I imagine that I may teach quite a bit once I've earned my Masters here at ITP and I believe that all of what we talked about and all of what we actually did in the class was extremely helpful in having me to be more open-minded about what teaching can look like."

"Getting more experience to articulate ideas to other and gaining practice teaching. It was also good to learn about scenarios we might encounter while attempting to teach in the real world/art world."

What were the objectives of this class?

"To learn to teach! Using the basic fundamentals of pedagogy, curriculum and syllabi building, along with the students' definition of art, the course taught us many ways to not only teach but also to learn."

"To make people feel in love with learning. To learn about pedagogy, purpose of learning and teaching, curriculum, the art of creating a syllabus..."
 
How would you evaluate the instructor? 

"Taeyoon is one of the most passionate professors I ever had. He put that in his teaching and this makes students feel very motivated to pursue the topic he teaches."

"Taeyoon was extremely empathetic and understanding to my situation, and was willing to work with me and allow me to engage at will, as well as gently push me out of comfort zone just enough without me to have issues. I recommend him highly as an instructor!"

"Learning the fundamentals of pedagogy, while also appreciating it's context in certain art practices. What unique qualities come from combining them? Also, social critique, and "unlearning" as a method of learning in a broader, cultural and political context."
