**School for Poetic Computation** is an artist run school in New York that was founded in 2013. A small group of students and faculty work closely to explore the intersections of code, design, hardware and theory — focusing especially on artistic intervention. It's a hybrid of a school, residency and research group.

_Our motto is: **more poetry, less demo**_
