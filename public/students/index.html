<h4>Simona De Rosa</h4>

<p> 
<a href="http://simonaderosa.tumblr.com/">Simona</a> is a designer, observer, researcher and strategist born in south of Italy, now living and working in Berlin at Nokia (HERE Maps). She studied at Polytechnic of Milan, at Design Faculty (2007), during 2009 deeply curious and attracted by the &ldquo;Next Billion People&rdquo; she moved to China to pursue a double master degree in Design &amp; Innovation at Tongji University, Shanghai.  Last May, she took part to <a href="http://gestaltenspace.tumblr.com/post/51724176169/gestalten-workshop-with-nicolas-felton-thank">The Art of Data-based Visual Narratives</a> by Nicholas Felton, where she had a revealing glimpse on the importance of code: it allows to deal with (big)data sets that go beyond what we can see with normal eyes.</p>

<p>Realizing that coding is not only about data representation, but actually coding is everywhere: from ordering food, to using an ATM, recording memories, talking to family and friends, Simona believes it&rsquo;s not too late to learn how to program, because it teaches you how to think!</p>

<h4>Mini Kim</h4>

<p>While exploring diverse career paths, <a href="http://www.minsunmini.com/">Mini Kim</a> fell in love with data visualization. During her free time she would spend hours making sense of the data being created around her. She hopes that her interest in data can ultimately result in impactful work.</p>

<p>Mini has just finished a year of the Interaction Design MFA program at the School of Visual Arts. She is taking a year off from the program to work at the UNICEF Innovation Unit and to explore her personal interest in art and coding. At UNICEF, Mini works on data visualization and system projects and got to travel to Senegal and Lebanon this summer.</p>

<p>Now at the School for Poetic Computation, she is looking forward to exploring new ways to express herself through data visualization and become a part of an artistic community. She is ready to learn from others, expand her thoughts and share her knowledge.</p>

<h4>Andy Clymer</h4>

<p>Originally from Southern California, <a href="http://www.andyclymer.com/">Andy Clymer</a> has been living and working in New York City as a Senior Type Designer and Developer at the Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones type foundry for the last eight years. While studying in the Type &amp; Media postgraduate course at the Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten (Royal Academy of Art) in The Hague, The Netherlands, Andy became increasingly drawn to the notion that type designers have had for centuries of building one&rsquo;s own tools for the job — mechanical bits and pieces, historically, and now bits and pieces of software.</p>

<p>Most recently, Andy has been teaching this approach to design in the Type@Cooper postgraduate program at the Cooper Union in New York City and to undergraduate type design students at the University of Arts in Philadelphia.</p>
