We are a group of artists, hackers and educators who are super committed to open source and open hardware, to radical openness and generosity.

As a group, we have taught at Parsons, Pratt, SVA, Columbia University and Cooper Union, as well as organized workshops at Eyebeam, Ars Electronica, Medialab Prado, YCAM and more. Through lectures, publishing and curating, we share passion for sharing knowledge and building community of creative practitioners.

## Amit Pitaru

[Amit](http://pitaru.com/) is a coder and designer. Formerly a professional musician, his work to date spans across experimental art, research, education, and entrepreneurial projects. A recurring theme in Amit’s work is the extreme attention to user-experience, specifically how technology can promote (or destroy) curiosity, literacy, and creativity.

As an artist, Amit develops novel instruments and methods for making music, animation, and dance. His work has been exhibited at the London Design Museum, Paris Pompidou Center, Lincoln Center, Israel National Museum, Sundance Film festival, Seoul Metropolitan Museum of Art, and ICC Museum in Tokyo.

As an educator, Amit develops curricula that focus on the coupling of technology and the creative thought process. He taught at New York University’s ITP and Cooper Union’s Arts department. Interested in alternative education environments, Amit is also the co founder of Kitchen Table Coders, hosting intimate workshops/salons for people who are eager to expand their love for coding.

## Zach Lieberman

Zach is one of the co-founders of openFrameworks, a C++ library for creative coding. He's currently working on the EyeWriter project, a low-cost, open source hardware and software toolkit that helps people draw with their eyes. The project has won the Design of the Year from the London Design Museum, FutureEverything prize and the Golden Nica in Interactive Art at Ars Electronica. It was also listed by Time Magazine as one the 50 best inventions in 2010.
