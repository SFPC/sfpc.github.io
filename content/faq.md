 _We have had a joke that this is going to be an answerless FAQ :) At this point, we have a lot more questions than answers. At any rate, here's some attempted answers. As we get closer to announcing the first call, this will tighten up_

## Administration

<dl>
<dt>Is the school for poetic computation a real school?</dt>
<dd>It is a ten week program lead by a team of faculty. It is a school in a sense there is a lot of learning and teaching happening in a physical space. It is also a residency for creative practitioners in art and technology to develop their ideas into projects and publish it through documentation and exhibition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Does the School issue certificate for graduation?</dt>
<dd>The school does not accredit any formal degrees but the group of alumni will grow into a lively community that will collaborate in the future. We hope students experience at the school and skill will be a validation for them to pursue a creative career.</dd>
<dl>
<dt>Who can become a student at the school?</dt>
<dd>Anyone who is excited by our mission statement and wants to create their ideas into projects. We are hoping to get somewhere between 15~20 students. We are looking for students who will make full time commitment for the period of session.</dd>
<dl>
<dt>How can I apply?</dt>
<dd>Our application period for the fall term has closed, but we are still acception applications on a rolling basis <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13HfY4UVZbA7NOwcF24EZ009Wfvl4M_OKGVcn8C5CJtY/viewform">here</a>. Please sign up at our mailing list to get the latest news.</dd>
<dl>
<dt>Is there tuition to attend the school?</dt>
<dd>There will be a fixed rate tuition to attend the school, somewhere between the cost of one and two courses at a university. We're still figuring out how low we can go, we think around $5,000 might make sense. A big part of the tuition goes toward paying for classroom and co-working space for students. We're also looking at scholarships, and hope to increase that portion of the program as we mature.</dd>
<dl>
<dt>How long is a term of the school?</dt>
<dd>Each term will be roughly ten weeks full time, so students can come on a tourist visa, etc</dd>
<dl>
<dt>Where will the school be located?</dt>
<dd>In the fall of 2013, we will be located in Dumbo, Brooklyn New York at the Made in NYC media center</dd>
<dl>
<dt>Can Non-US Citizen apply?</dt>
<dd>Yes! We are designing one session to be 10 week in order to accommodate International students visiting with a tourist visa.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Can I work while attending this school?</dt>
<dd>No, we want all students to be full time during the 10 weeks</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>How many terms per years are you planning?</dt>
<dd>we are planning 2 or 3 terms per year with different themes / teachers, so students can continue at the school if they'd like</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Can I come for a portion of the time?</dt>
<dd>No, we want students to be full time for the whole 10 weeks</dd>
</dl>

</dl>

## Pedagogy

<dl>
<dt>What is the teaching philosophy?</dt>
<dd>We celebrate failure and collaboration. Our classes are going to be a mix of lecture, demo and lab hours. We respect our students and support them as artist and educator. We hope our students will have the experience to create projects on their own and to teach after the program.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>How much of programming skills do I need to get accepted?</dt>
<dd>The School encourages students to have some familiarity with programming and technology in general. If you are an absolute beginner, there will be assignments prior to the School that will get you familiar with the medium.</dd>

<dd> Here's alist of shorter, non degree granting schools: [hacker school](https://www.hackerschool.com/), [code fellows](http://www.codefellows.org/rails), [starter league](http://www.starterleague.com/). There's also places like [the brooklyn institute](http://thebrooklyninstitute.com/the-institute), [LA game space](http://lagamespace.org/alpha/), [kitchen table coders](kitchentablecoders.com). [Teachablefile](http://teachablefile.org/) is a huge list of artist run schools. This book, [Art School: (Propositions for the 21st Century)](http://www.amazon.com/Art-School-Propositions-21st-Century/dp/0262134934), is a good intro to alternative art schools.
